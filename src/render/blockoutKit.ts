/**
 * A tiny procedural geometry kit for blockout characters.
 *
 * **Why this exists.** The M2 rider was primitives — a capsule per limb, a
 * capsule torso, a sphere head, boxes for everything that needed to be a
 * different colour. That was the right call at M2, when the job was to prove a
 * joint hierarchy. It is the wrong shape for a figure the player looks at for
 * three minutes at a time: the owner's note on the M7.5 build was that the
 * world reads low-poly, and the rider is the part of it the chase camera never
 * looks away from.
 *
 * The constraint that shapes everything here is the **draw-call budget**
 * (`DESIGN.md` §8): the frame ceiling is 150, the slice sits at 102, and the
 * ghost is a second rig. Detail added as *more meshes* costs two draw calls a
 * part. So detail is added as **more geometry inside the same meshes** instead,
 * and this file is what makes that affordable to author:
 *
 *   - `loftGeometry` builds a body from a stack of authored cross-sections, so
 *     a jacket can have shoulders, a waist, and a hem instead of being one
 *     capsule — at the cost of triangles, which the budget has in abundance
 *     (209,782 of 400,000 at M11).
 *   - `patchGeometry` builds a panel that lies *on* that body, sampling the
 *     same profile. This is the whole reason the identity blue stops floating:
 *     a box laid across a curved back stands off it at the corners, and a patch
 *     of the back itself cannot.
 *   - `mergeGeometries` folds a part's pieces into one buffer, so a helmet
 *     shell, its rear spoiler, and its chin bar are one mesh and one draw call.
 *
 * **Shade is a vertex multiplier, not a colour.** Every generator writes a
 * `color` attribute, and the materials that consume these geometries set
 * `vertexColors: true`, so the attribute *multiplies* the material colour
 * rather than replacing it. That keeps one material per look — the jacket, the
 * trousers, and a seam are all one draw call — while still separating their
 * values, which is what stops a black-clad rider reading as a single mass in
 * shade. Default 1 is "exactly the material colour", so a part that forgets to
 * pass one is not the black mesh `DESIGN.md` §7c warns about.
 *
 * **Every generator also writes `uv`, and nothing was obliged to use it until
 * M23.** A loft already walks a surface parameterization to place its vertices
 * — the angle around a section and the height up the profile — and a patch
 * already walks its own square; handing those two numbers on as texture
 * coordinates costs one attribute and closes the resolution ceiling that
 * vertex tint has. A material with no `map` ignores the attribute entirely, so
 * every look built before this change renders exactly as it did. `mapUvInto`
 * is how a look folds a part's unit square onto one page of a shared atlas,
 * which is what keeps printed graphics free of draw calls.
 *
 * The one thing to know about a loft's `u`: the seam column is **shared**, so
 * the last quad runs the coordinate backwards from `(radial-1)/radial` to 0.
 * The seam sits at `u = 0`, which by `loftPoint`'s convention is the rider's
 * LEFT, and art is placed away from it. A duplicated seam column would fix the
 * wrap and split the normals, which is a shading crack down a rider's side in
 * exchange for a texel nobody is looking at.
 *
 * Nothing here is animated and nothing here is read by `simulation/`. It is
 * geometry construction, run once per rig.
